# StockReportGen
A simple report generator which produces some graphs based on a stocks historical prices.

Currently does nothing fancy.

Running:
 *  Place stock code (yahoo finance code) e.g. AMD, GOOG, etc.. in settings.csv, under stockname
 *  `Rscript compile.r`#
 *  View generated report

No machine learning algorithms are used currently in this project, all it does is give you an idea of the past performance of your chosen stock.
